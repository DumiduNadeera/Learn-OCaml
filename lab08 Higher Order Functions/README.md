**Higher Order Functions**
-----
Define a higher order function to compute the numerical derivative of a function f at point x.
```ocaml
let derivative fx x = 
	let dx = 0.001 in 
	(fx (x+.dx) -. fx x) /. dx ;;
```

But functional languages like OCaml support to write these functions in more abstract way. 
The following function returns a derivative function of any given function. Not the evaluated result.
```ocaml
let derivative fx =
	let dx = 0.001 in
	fun x -> (fx (x+.dx) -. fx x) /. dx ;;
```

The Trapezoid rule is a numerical method for calculating definite integrals.
Write a higher order function to calculate integral using this formula (Hint: you may use series_sum.)

```ocaml
let trapezoid fx a b n =
	let h = (b-.a)/.n in
	
	let rec series_sum tn =
		if tn > b then 0.
		else 
			let tnp1 = tn +. h in
			fx tn +. fx tnp1 +. series_sum tnp1 in

    (h /. 2.) *. (series_sum a) ;;
```
Write a higher order function that uses Newtonâ€™s method to numerically approximate the (real) roots of a function. Given a function f and its derivative f', begin with an initial guess of x0. Then successively refine the approximation using the formula
*x(n+1) = xn - f(xn)/f'(xn)*
The process stops when f (x) < e for some small tolerance e.
```ocaml
let derivative fx =
	let dx = 0.001 in
	fun x -> (fx (x+.dx) -. fx x) /. dx ;;
	
let abs x = 
	if x < 0. then -.x
	else x;;
 
let newton f x0 e = 
	let rec loop xn = 
		let xnp1 = xn -. (f xn /. (derivative f) xn) in
		let error = abs (xnp1 -. xn) in
		
		if error < e then xn
		else loop xnp1 in

	loop x0 ;;
```
